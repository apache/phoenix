Apache Phoenix [1] Incubator project is a SQL skin over HBase delivered as a client-embedded 
JDBC driver targeting low latency queries over HBase data. Apache Phoenix takes your SQL query, 
compiles it into a series of HBase scans, and orchestrates the running of those scans to produce 
regular JDBC result sets.

To get started using Phoenix, see the About and Using section on Phoenix website [1]

Upgrading from Phoenix 2.2.x to Apache Phoenix 3.0/4.0
------------------------------------------------------
By default, Phoenix 2.2.x tables are not automatically upgraded to
Apache Phoenix 3.0/4.0 tables. Since pre-Apache 2.2.x code lines have
a different package structure (com.salesforce.phoenix) than the 3.0/4.0
code line(org.apache.phoenix), the two installations may actually
coexist. An existing Phoenix table may either remain as a 2.2.x table
or be upgraded to 3.0/4.0 table, but not both. In addition, a client
JVM may either use the 3.0/4.0 driver or the 2.2.x driver, but not
both. Upgrade, however, is a one way street: once a table is upgrade
to 3.0/4.0, it stays that way.

Note that upgrading a table will not affect its data - only the
metadata of the table will change. In order to upgrade tables from
2.2.x to 3.0/4.0, the following must be done *BEFORE* the first
connection to a cluster which has 3.0/4.0 installed on it.

* Add a new phoenix.client.autoUpgradeWhiteList config parameter to
  your client-side hbase-sites.xml. Make sure the directory containing
  the hbase-sites.xml is on the classpath of your client so that HBase
  finds it. The value you use for the parameter depends on which
  tables you want to upgrade:

  * To upgrade all tables use a value of *. This will cause all Phoenix
    2.2.x tables to be automatically converted to the new 3.0.0 structure
    when the first connection occurs. For example:

        <pre><configuration>
          <property>
            <name>phoenix.client.autoUpgradeWhiteList</name>
            <value>*</value>
          </property>
        </configuration></pre>

  * To upgrade only some tables use a comma separated list of full table
    names. In that case, only those tables and their secondary indexes
    will be upgraded on first connection to a cluster. Note that table
    names are case sensitive. For example, the following would upgrade
    my_schema.my_table and MY_OTHER_TABLE:

        <pre><configuration>
          <property>
            <name>phoenix.client.autoUpgradeWhiteList</name>
            <value>my_schema.my_table,MY_OTHER_TABLE</value>
          </property>
        </configuration></pre>

* After the first connection has been made to a cluster with Phoenix
  3.0/4.0 installed, no further upgrade will take place. However, you
  may force it to take place again by removing the UpgradeTo30 attribute
  from the SYSTEM.CATALOG HBase table metadata. Then, on the next
  connection to the cluster, upgrade will again occur as describe above.
