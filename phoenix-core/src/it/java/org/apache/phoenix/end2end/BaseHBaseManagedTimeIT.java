/**
 * Base class for tests that let HBase set timestamps.
 * We need to separate these from tests that rely on clients 
 * to set timestamps, because we create/destroy the Phoenix tables
 * between tests and only allow a table time stamp to increase.
 * Without this separation table deletion/creation would fail.
 *
 * Try and use (@link BaseHBaseManagedTimeTableReuseIT) and only
 * extend this class if really necessary.  It is very slow as
 * we have to delete tables which takes up to 10 seconds per test case.
 * All tests extending this class use the mini cluster that is
 * different from the mini cluster used by test classes extending 
 * {@link BaseClientManagedTimeIT}.
