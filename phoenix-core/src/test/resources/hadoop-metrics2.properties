#There are two options with file names:
#  1. hadoop-metrics2-[prefix].properties
#  2. hadoop-metrics2.properties
# Either will be loaded by the metrics system (but not both).
#
# NOTE: The metrics system is only initialized once per JVM (but does ref-counting, so we can't
#shutdown and restart), so we only load the first prefix that we find. Generally, this will be
#phoenix (unless someone else registers first, but for many clients, there should only be one).
#
# Usually, you would use hadoop-metrics2-phoenix.properties, but we use the generic
# hadoop-metrics2.properties to ensure it these are loaded regardless of where we are running,
# assuming there isn't another config on the classpath.

#
# When specifying sinks, the syntax to use is:
#    [prefix].[source|sink].[instance].[options]
# See javadoc of package-info.java for org.apache.hadoop.metrics2 for detail
