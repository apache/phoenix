/**
 * Version of {@link Metric} that can be used when the metric isn't getting concurrently modified/accessed by multiple
 * threads and the memory consistency effects of happen-before can be established. For example - phoenix client side
 * metrics are modified/accessed by only one thread at a time. Further, the actions of threads in the phoenix client
 * thread pool happen-before the actions of the thread that performs the aggregation of metrics. This makes
 * {@link NonAtomicMetric} a good fit for storing Phoenix's client side request level metrics.
