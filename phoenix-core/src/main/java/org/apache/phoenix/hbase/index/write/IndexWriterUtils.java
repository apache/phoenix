  /**
   * Maximum number of threads to allow per-table when writing. Each writer thread (from
   * {@link IndexWriterUtils#NUM_CONCURRENT_INDEX_WRITER_THREADS_CONF_KEY}) has a single HTable.
   * However, each table is backed by a threadpool to manage the updates to that table. this
   * specifies the number of threads to allow in each of those tables. Generally, you shouldn't need
   * to change this, unless you have a small number of indexes to which most of the writes go.
   * Defaults to: {@value #DEFAULT_NUM_PER_TABLE_THREADS}.
   * <p>
   * For tables to which there are not a lot of writes, the thread pool automatically will decrease
   * the number of threads to one (though it can burst up to the specified max for any given table),
   * so increasing this to meet the max case is reasonable.
   * <p>
   * Setting this value too small can cause <b>catastrophic cluster failure</b>. The way HTable's
   * underlying pool works is such that is does direct hand-off of tasks to threads. This works fine
   * because HTables are assumed to work in a single-threaded context, so we never get more threads
   * than regionservers. In a multi-threaded context, we can easily grow to more than that number of
   * threads. Currently, HBase doesn't support a custom thread-pool to back the HTable via the
   * coprocesor hooks, so we can't modify this behavior.
