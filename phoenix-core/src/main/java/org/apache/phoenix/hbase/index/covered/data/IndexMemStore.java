/**
 * Like the HBase {@link MemStore}, but without all that extra work around maintaining snapshots and
 * sizing (for right now). We still support the concurrent access (in case indexes are built in
 * parallel).
 * <p>
 * 
 We basically wrap a KeyValueSkipListSet, just like a regular MemStore, except we are:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>not dealing with
 *    <ul>
 *      <li>space considerations</li>
 *      <li>a snapshot set</li>
 *    </ul>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>ignoring memstore timestamps in favor of deciding when we want to overwrite keys based on how
 *    we obtain them</li>
 *   <li>ignoring time range updates (so 
 *    {@link ReseekableScanner#shouldUseScanner(Scan, SortedSet, long)} isn't supported from
 *    {@link #getScanner()}).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * We can ignore the memstore timestamps because we know that anything we get from the local region
 * is going to be MVCC visible - so it should just go in. However, we also want overwrite any
 * existing state with our pending write that we are indexing, so that needs to clobber the KVs we
 * get from the HRegion. This got really messy with a regular memstore as each KV from the MemStore
 * frequently has a higher MemStoreTS, but we can't just up the pending KVs' MemStoreTs because a
 * memstore relies on the MVCC readpoint, which generally is less than {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}.
 * <p>
 * By realizing that we don't need the snapshot or space requirements, we can go much faster than
 * the previous implementation. Further, by being smart about how we manage the KVs, we can drop the
 * extra object creation we were doing to wrap the pending KVs (which we did previously to ensure
 * they sorted before the ones we got from the HRegion). We overwrite {@link KeyValue}s when we add
 * them from external sources {@link #add(KeyValue, boolean)}, but then don't overwrite existing
 * keyvalues when read them from the underlying table (because pending keyvalues should always
 * overwrite current ones) - this logic is all contained in LocalTableState.
 * @see LocalTableState
