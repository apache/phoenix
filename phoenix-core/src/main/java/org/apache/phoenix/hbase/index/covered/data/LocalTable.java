/**
 * Wrapper around a lazily instantiated, local HTable.
 * <p>
 * Previously, we had used various row and batch caches. However, this ends up being very
 * complicated when attempting manage updating and invalidating the cache with no real gain as any
 * row accessed multiple times will likely be in HBase's block cache, invalidating any extra caching
 * we are doing here. In the end, its simpler and about as efficient to just get the current state
 * of the row from HBase and let HBase manage caching the row from disk on its own.
