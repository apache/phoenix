/**
 * Sink for request traces ({@link SpanReceiver}) that pushes writes to {@link TraceWriter} in a
 * format that we can more easily consume.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Rather than write directly to a phoenix table, we drop it into the metrics queue so we can more
 * cleanly handle it asynchronously.Currently, {@link MilliSpan} submits the span in a synchronized
 * block to all the receivers, which could have a lot of overhead if we are submitting to multiple
 * receivers.
 * <p>
 * The format of the generated metrics is this:
 * <ol>
 * <li>All Metrics from the same span have the same trace id (allowing correlation in the sink)</li>
 * <li>The description of the metric describes what it contains. For instance,
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link MetricInfo#PARENT} is the id of the parent of this span. (Root span is
 * {@link Span#ROOT_SPAN_ID}).</li>
 * <li>{@link MetricInfo#START} is the start time of the span</li>
 * <li>{@link MetricInfo#END} is the end time of the span</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <i>So why even submit to {@link TraceWriter} if we only have a single source?</i>
 * <p>
 * This allows us to make the updates in batches. We might have spans that finish before other spans
 * (for instance in the same parent). By batching the updates we can lessen the overhead on the
 * client, which is also busy doing 'real' work. <br>
 * This class is custom implementation of metrics queue and handles batch writes to the Phoenix Table
 * via another thread. Batch size and number of threads are configurable.
 * <p>
