/**
 * Only allow the 'latest' timestamp of each family:qualifier pair, ensuring that they aren't
 * covered by a previous delete. This is similar to some of the work the ScanQueryMatcher does to
 * ensure correct visibility of keys based on deletes.
 * <p>
 * No actual delete {@link KeyValue}s are allowed to pass through this filter - they are always
 * skipped.
 * <p>
 * Note there is a little bit of conceptually odd behavior (though it matches the HBase
 * specifications) around point deletes ({@link KeyValue} of type {@link Type#Delete}. These deletes
 * only apply to a single {@link KeyValue} at a single point in time - they essentially completely
 * 'cover' the existing {@link Put} at that timestamp. However, they don't 'cover' any other
 * keyvalues at older timestamps. Therefore, if there is a point-delete at ts = 5, and puts at ts =
 * 4, and ts = 5, we will only allow the put at ts = 4.
 * <p>
 * Expects {@link KeyValue}s to arrive in sorted order, with 'Delete' {@link Type} {@link KeyValue}s
 * ({@link Type#DeleteColumn}, {@link Type#DeleteFamily}, {@link Type#Delete})) before their regular
 * {@link Type#Put} counterparts.
