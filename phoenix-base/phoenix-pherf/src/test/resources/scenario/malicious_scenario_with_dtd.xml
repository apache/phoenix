              This pattern is really useful when you want to write data to multi-tenant view and the tenant id is
              tightly bound to the scenario. In such cases you can't create the view through the data model flow.
              The value of the tableName attribute is name of the view that is dynamically created based on the DDL
              in the ddl attribute. Queries accessing the View will need to manually make sure Pherf was run with the -l option at
              least once.
