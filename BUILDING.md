<b>[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b> is a SQL skin over HBase delivered as a
client-embedded JDBC driver targeting low latency queries over HBase data. Visit the Apache
Phoenix website <b>[here](http://phoenix.apache.org/)</b>.


Building Apache Phoenix
========================

Phoenix uses Maven (3.X) to build all its necessary resources.

Building from source
--------------------

On first setup, you may need to run `$ mvn install -DskipTests`
to install the local jars. This is a side-effect of multi-module maven projects

To re-generate the antlr based files:  
`$ mvn process-sources`

To build the jars and the assembly tarball:  
`$ mvn package`
and optionally, to just skip all the tests and build the jars:  
`$ mvn package -DskipTests`

Note: javadocs are generated in target/apidocs

HBase version compatibility
---------------------------

As Phoenix uses *limited public* HBase APIs, which sometimes change even within a minor release,
Phoenix may not build or work with older releases of HBase, or ones that were released after
Phoenix, even within the same HBase minor release.

By default, Phoenix will be built for the latest known patch level of the earliest HBase 1.x
minor release that Phoenix supports.

You can specify the targeted HBase minor release by setting the `hbase.profile` system property for 
maven.

You can also specify the exact HBase release to build Phoenix with by additionally
setting the `hbase.version` system property.

 * `mvn clean install` will use the latest known patch release of the the earliest supported HBase 1 minor relese
 * `mvn clean install -Dhbase.profile=1.4` will use the latest known patch release of HBase 1.4
 * `mvn clean install -Dhbase.profile=1.4 -Dhbase.version=1.4.3` will build with HBase 1.4.3

Phoenix verifies the specified `hbase.profile` and `hbase.version` properties, and will reject
combinations that are known not to work. You may disable this verification by adding
`-Denforcer.skip=true` to the maven command line. (In case you are using an HBase package that
modifies the canonical version number in a way that Phoenix cannot parse)

Importing into eclipse
----------------------

Use the m2e eclipse plugin and do Import->Maven Project and just pick the root 'phoenix' directory.

Running the tests
-----------------

All Unit tests  
`$ mvn clean test`

All Unit Tests and Integration tests
`$ mvn clean verify`

The verify maven target will also run dependency:analyze-only, which checks if the dependencies 
used in the code and declared in the maven projects match. The code coverage report would be
generated at /target/site/jacoco/index.html

To skip code coverage analysis
`$ mvn verify -Dskip.code-coverage`

Findbugs
--------

Findbugs report is generated in /target/site  
`$ mvn site`

Generate Apache Web Site
------------------------

checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/phoenix  
`$ build.sh`
