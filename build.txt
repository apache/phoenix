# Building Apache Phoenix
=========================

Phoenix uses Maven (3.X) to build all its necessary resources. 

## Building from source
=======================

On first setup, you may need to run
	$ mvn install -DskipTests
to install the local jars. This is a side-effect of multi-module maven projects

1. To re-generate the antlr based files:
	$ mvn process-sources

2. To build the jars
	$ mvn package
and optionally, to just skip all the tests and build the jars:
	$ mvn package -DskipTests

Note: javadocs are generated in target/apidocs

## Importing into eclipse
=========================

Use the m2e eclipse plugin and do Import->Maven Project and just pick the root 'phoenix' directory.

## Running the tests
====================

1. All tests 
	$ mvn clean test

## Findbugs
===========
Findbugs report is generated in /target/site
	$ mvn site
	

## Generate Apache Web Site
===========================
checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/phoenix
        $ build.sh
